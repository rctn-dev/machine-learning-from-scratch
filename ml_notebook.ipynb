    "# MACHINE LEARNING FROM SCRATCH    \n",
    "* Machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to <span style=\"color:orange\">learn without being explicitly programmmed</span>.  \n",
    "* Two main types of machine learning are <span style=\"color:orange\">supervised learning</span> and <span style=\"color:orange\">unsupervised learning</span>.  \n",
    "* Of these two, the supervised learning is the type of machine learning that is used most in many real-world applications and has seen the most rapid advancements and innovation. \n",
    "# 1. Supervised Learning  \n",
    "* The 99% of the economic value created by machine learning today is through one type of machine learning, which is called supervised learning.\n",
    "* Supervised learning maps input (x) to output (y), where the learning algorithm learns from the <span style=\"color:orange\">right</span> answers.\n",
    "* Key characteristic of supervised learning is that you give your learning algorithm examples to learn from, called <span style=\"color:orange\">training set</span>.\n",
    "* The two major types of supervised learning are <span style=\"color:orange\">regression</span> and <span style=\"color:orange\">classification</span>.\n",
    "    ### 1.1 Regression\n",
    "* In a regression application, the learning algorithm has to predict numbers from within <span style=\"color:orange\">infinitely-many options</span>. To clarify, assume you have a prediction function which might pick any real number within the real number range of (0,1) as an output result such as 0.19, 0.73456, or 0.2717876756.\n",
    "    * The House price prediction problem is a typical example of these kinds of problems.\n"
